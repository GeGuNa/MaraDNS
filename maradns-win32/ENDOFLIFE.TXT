The Windows 32-bit binary maradns.exe is now deprecated.  It will no longer
be supported come June 21, 2023, and will no longer be updated except
for critical security issues.

Please note that Deadwood continues to remain fully supported in
Windows; this *only* affects the non-recursive authoritative server
(which I do not think anyone still runs as this 32-bit Windows binary).
